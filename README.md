Environment Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If running on an HPC cluster, ensure your Python environment aligns with the cluster's requirements (see the SLURM batch script example below for details on environment configuration).

Usage
Running the Training Script Locally
To train the UNet model locally, use the train_unet.py script.

bash
Copy code
python train_unet.py
Arguments for train_unet.py
Modify the paths for your datasets and hyperparameters in the main function inside train_unet.py:

image_dir, mask_dir: Directories for training images and masks.
image_dir_val, mask_dir_val: Directories for validation images and masks.
image_dir_test, mask_dir_test: Directories for test images and masks.
num_epochs: Number of training epochs.
batch_size: Batch size for training and validation.
learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.
